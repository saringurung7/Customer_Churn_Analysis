Summary and Recommendation 

1. Overall Churn Overview 

● Total Customers: 7,043

● Total Churned: 1,869

● Churn Rate: 25.54%

This means 1 out of every 4 customers leaves the company, signaling a major retention concern. 

2. Demographic Breakdown 

a. Gender vs Churn 

● Male Churn: ~26% 

● Female Churn: ~25% 

Interpretation: 
There is no meaningful churn difference between genders. Gender is not a predictive feature for customer retention. 

b. Senior Citizen Status 
● Senior Citizens Churn: ~42% 
● Non-Senior Citizens Churn: ~23% 

Key Insight: 
Senior citizens churn nearly twice as much as younger customers. 
Possible drivers: affordability issues, digital service challenges, or service relevance. 

3. Tenure Influence on Churn 

Your histogram clearly shows: 
● Customers with 1–2 months tenure churn at the highest rate, often exceeding 60%+. 
● Churn drops sharply after 6 months. 
● Customers with more than 2 years tenure have churn rates below 10%. 

Interpretation: 
Early-stage experience is the biggest factor. 
Most customers who churn do so within the first few months, indicating poor onboarding, unmet expectations, or pricing dissatisfaction. 

4. Contract Type & Churn 
This is one of the strongest predictors in the dataset. 

Month-to-Month Contract 
● Makes up: ~55% of the customer base 
● Churn Rate: 43% 

One-Year Contract 
● Churn Rate: ~11% 

Two-Year Contract 
● Churn Rate: ~3% 

Interpretation: 
● Month-to-month customers are 14 times more likely to churn than two-year contract customers. 
● Long-term contracts create stickiness and reduce churn drastically. 
● Price sensitivity and lack of commitment drive short-term customers to leave quickly. 

5. Service Usage Patterns & Churn 
From your multi-plot service comparison: 

Phone Service 
● Phone-service users churn less (~25%) than those without phone service (~31%). 
● Customers without essential services tend to leave more. 

Internet Service 
● Fiber-optic customers have significantly higher churn (~41%) than DSL users (~19%). 
● “No internet service” category has the lowest churn (~8%). 

Interpretation: 
● Fiber users likely face issues with pricing or performance. 
● DSL customers are more stable. 
● Customers with no internet service are often fixed-line users with lower dissatisfaction. 

Add-on Services (Online Backup, Security, Device Protection, Tech Support) 
Across multiple subplots: 
● Customers without these add-ons show higher churn, typically 32–40%. 
● Customers with these services show lower churn, usually 15–20%. 

Interpretation: 
Service bundling leads to deeper engagement and lower churn. 
Cross-selling security and support services may reduce churn further. 

6. Key Customer Segments Most Likely to Churn 
Based on your charts, the highest-risk customers are:

1. Month-to-month customers 
2. Tenure < 6 months 
3. Senior citizens 
4. Fiber-optic internet users 
5. Customers with fewer add-on services 
6. Customers without tech support / online protection 
This combination results in churn rates exceeding 40–60% in some segments. 

7. High-Level Recommendations 
1. Improve Onboarding for New Customers 
Target the first 3 months with: 
● Personalized follow-ups 
● Discounted introductory offers 
● Setup support

2. Push for Longer-Term Contracts 
Offer: 
● Discounts for 1-year & 2-year plans 
● Value-added service bundles

3. Improve Fiber-Optic Customer Experience 
● Investigate performance or pricing issues 
● Offer competitive upgrade or retention plans

4. Promote Add-on Services 
Security, backup, and tech support services correlate with 15–20% lower churn.

This analysis reveals that churn is driven primarily by contract length, tenure, and service usage, 
not gender. The churn rate is 25.54%, but jumps to 43% for month-to-month customers and over 60% for 
new users with low tenure. Senior citizens and fiber-optic users are also highly vulnerable segments. 
Customers who use bundled services and long-term contracts churn significantly less. Focusing on 
onboarding, service quality improvements, and contract conversions could materially reduce churn.
